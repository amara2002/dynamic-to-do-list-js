# Advanced Application of JavaScript - Dynamic To-Do List

Welcome to the **Advanced Application of JavaScript** project! This project involves building a dynamic To-Do List application that allows users to add, display, and remove tasks interactively. It highlights advanced JavaScript techniques such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and localStorage for data persistence.

---

## Project Overview

This To-Do List app demonstrates how to:

- Select and manipulate DOM elements dynamically.
- Attach event listeners to handle user interactions like clicks and keypresses.
- Persist data using `localStorage`, so tasks remain saved even after refreshing or closing the browser.

By the end of this project, you will have a functional To-Do List that showcases your understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts and your ability to create interactive web applications.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the list.
